PowerPoint Rust Tools
=====================

PowerPoint Add-In that offers some tools to work with Rust code on slides. Currently it's only a "syntax highlight the Rust code in this text box"-tool.

***Beware***: this Code is **horribly** written! I don't know anything about C# nor MS Office development. The code suits *my* needs and contains many hard-coded values. In fact, I'm pretty sure this is the worst code I wrote in the last few years ... 

Feel free to try to improve it, though :wink: I'd be happy to accept a PR.
